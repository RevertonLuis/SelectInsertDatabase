# Variables that will be loaded
variables  Temperature Precipitation RelativeHumidity Wind10m Wind50m

# Variables description
# RAW = will load the variable
# POS = in this case the varibles will be used to
# compute another variable. If the pos process
# is not implemented then the variable will not
# be inserted into the database

# Temperature POS = change Kelvin to Celsius 
Temperature    POS T2

# Precipitation POS = 1) RAIN + RAINC and 2) Compute hourly acc
Precipitation  POS  RAINC RAINNC

# Wind10 POS = 1) Compute Wind Direction
#              2) Compute Wind Magnitude
#              3) Compute Wind Direction names
